### Go is a Functional Programming Lang
- In FP languages, functions can be stored inside variables
- Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
- Functions can return functions as return values (Higher order functions)
- There are also anonymous functions, which can be executed immidiately or can be passed as arguments
