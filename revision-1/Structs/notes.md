## Structs
- Think of them like Javscript objects or Python dictionaries but a little different
- When we define a struct, we must define all their properties beforehand
- Then we create a variable of that struct that matches it's definition

```go
    type person struct {
        firstName  string
        lastName string
        age int
    }
```
